### What is a ray tracer?

**TL;DR:** A ray tracer is a program that takes inputs of objects (like spheres or light sources), renders them using principles of optics and computer graphics, and outputs an image! In fact, this is how CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) is made, and so is a very useful tool.

**Specifics:** A ray tracer uses basic principles of optics (e.g., reflection, refraction, etc.). It traces every light ray from a source to a certain object, determines if it intersects that object, and at what angle it does so (in order to determine the color of that specific pixel). Java proves a useful language for this, as Object-Oriented Programming is helpful when dealing with multiple instances of a type of object. Furthermore, rendering and displaying graphics is a lot simpler with Java than with several other languages (e.g., Python).

### Search Popularity

Actually, Google Searches for ray tracing were on an all-time high in August of 2019. Now, in the September of that year, they are also extremely high.

### Release Updates

* Sept. 2, 2019 -- v0.48
	* Initial code with 48% functional ray-tracer. Many times, the output image is obviously inaccurate.
